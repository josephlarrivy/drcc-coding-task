# DRCC coding task
This project demonstrates a full-stack application integrating React for the frontend and C# for the backend. While the primary task is to perform basic mathematical operations, like addition and averaging on user inputs, the main goal was to exhibit competence in building a cohesive full-stack application that uses C# as the primary language to do the mathematical operations.

### Getting started
1. Ensure you have Node.js and npm installed for running the React frontend.
2. .NET Core SDK should be installed to run the C# backend.

### Running the application
Run the frontend in a terminal:
```
cd client
npm install
npm start
```

Run the backend in a terminal:
```
cd server
dotnet run
```
